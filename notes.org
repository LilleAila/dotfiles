**** TODO Find out if =base00= or =base01= is better here.
This affects things like number keys in qalculate, and popup menus in firefox. On one hand, leaving it as =base01= will make the calculator buttons stand out a bit more, but if it gets changed to =base00=, most of the =userChrome= for firefox can be removed..
